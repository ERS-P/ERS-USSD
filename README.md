![ers_ussd_opti.gif](https://s9.gifyu.com/images/ers_ussd_opti.gif)


An Emergency Response System (ERS) is a generic application 
that allows people to report an emergency such as a fire outbreak, 
robbery, flood, violence, and 
medical emergencies to appropriate emergency units such as police 
service, fire service, and ambulance service using a minimal 
approach through the help of technology.

This USSD application is an adaptation of an [ERS mobile application](https://github.com/ERS-P/emergency-response-system-mobile)
we built for our final year group project. It was built as a supplementary feature
for the ERS, especially for cituations where an end-user may not be able to access the mobile application.
